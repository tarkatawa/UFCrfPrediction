# UFCPred RF API

Flask application to run my UFC Pred Machine Learning Model.

## TODO List

- ~~Move training data to startup.~~
- ~~Modularize code.~~
- Write validations in application level.
- Deploy to the Internet.
- Code quality improvements: `black`, `isort`, and `pylint`.
- Package management? `poetry` or `requirements.txt`?
